v1.2
	Added:
		1. Add usage/system tracking
			- time spent on computer (by user and computer, can be calculated from process logs.)
			- Current User
			- User History (Technically stored in process logs)
		2. Update DataConnector to v1.2: Mysql and HTTPS mode
			- Tries to load through HTTPS, if it connects it then tries to connect to Mysql, if it fails the mode is set to http. 
			- If http mode fails it is set in Offline mode for 2 minutes. After 2 minutes, the process repeats.
			- HTTPS should post the data to the resolved IP. This site should be password protected using HTTP Auth, but visible to the world.
			- HTTPS mode executes SQL on the server and returns the result. The SQL needs to be sent with a md5 hash to the authenticated HTTPS session.
			- In HTTPS mode, the server needs to poll for commands in case TCP isn't an option. The poll will retreive only headers and occur once every 2.5 minutes.
		3. Add check to require .NET 3.5 before version 1.3+ is installed.
